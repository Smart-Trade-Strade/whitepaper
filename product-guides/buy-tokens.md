When the Private Transaction (Private Tx) feature is enabled, the slippage is automatically set to 10%. This setting is designed to safeguard transactions from potential sandwich attacks or frontrunning attempts.

**Customizing Slippage with Private Tx Disabled:**

If you wish to have greater control over your slippage settings, you can consider disabling the Private Tx setting. Here's how you can customize your slippage:

**Buy Settings (Expandable Panel):** Clicking on the Buy Settings panel will reveal additional options for configuring your buy transaction:

* **Use Private Transaction:** Decide whether you want to execute the transaction privately.
* **Frontrun Other Traders:** Opt to pay a higher gas fee for a chance to outpace other transactions and secure a priority spot.
* **Slippage:** Adjust the desired slippage by using the slider, or you can choose to enable Autoslippage.

* **NAME:** Displays the name and symbol of the BSC20 token.
