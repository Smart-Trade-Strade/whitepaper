\-> Whenever you engage in trades on the Smart Trade platform, the trading wallets interface with the Smart Trade router contract. If you're purchasing a cryptocurrency, the router contract deducts the fee from your input amount in the cryptocurrency you're using.&#x20;

<summary>Is Smart Trade a secure platform?</summary>

\-> Private keys are safeguarded through the use of standard industry encryption practices. These keys remain inaccessible to anyone, be it on our servers, databases, or stored on our website. In contrast to centralized exchanges (CEX), Smart Trade users retain control over their private keys associated with the trading wallets created by the platform.&#x20;

\-> You can import these keys into tools like Metamask, granting you complete authority over your funds within Smart Trade whenever you desire. It's always advisable to regard your wallet as a "hot wallet" in terms of security precautions. We're continually enhancing our features to provide enhanced wallet security measures in the future.&#x20;

\-> For instance, we're working on implementing an automated BSC transfer feature that triggers when your balance surpasses a personalized threshold amount.
