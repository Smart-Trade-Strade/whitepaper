<summary>Is Smart Trade Secure?</summary>

\-> Private keys are encrypted using widely-recognized industry encryption protocols, ensuring that they remain inaccessible to any unauthorized entities. Our servers, databases, and website do not store these private keys. Differing from centralized exchanges (CEX), Smart Trade provides users with access to the private keys associated with the trading wallets generated by the platform.&#x20;

\-> This affords you the capability to import these keys into Metamask, granting you full control over your funds within Smart Trade whenever you deem necessary. It's important to approach your wallet as a "hot wallet," adopting the same security considerations as you would with any CEX.&#x20;

\-> We're actively developing new features to enhance your wallet security experience in the near future. For example, one upcoming feature involves automatically transferring BSC out when your balance surpasses a customized threshold amount.

<summary>How are private keys safeguarded?</summary>

\-> Private keys are subjected to encryption procedures both when at rest and during transit, employing industry-standard symmetric key encryption/decryption techniques. We maintain a stringent policy of not storing private keys within our servers, databases, or other systems.

<summary>What's the recommended approach to utilizing Smart Trade wallets?</summary>

\-> Exercise the same caution with Smart Trade-generated trading wallets as you would with "hot wallets," whether in the context of a CEX or otherwise. Adhering to these principles is crucial: Limit the storage of assets within these wallets to those actively used for trading purposes. Avoid importing your personal wallets into Smart Trade unless a compelling reason necessitates such an action.&#x20;

\-> Periodically regenerate new wallets to enhance security. However, a key advantage Smart Trade offers over traditional CEX\`s is the ability for users to export the private keys of their Smart Trade-generated trading wallets.&#x20;

\->This empowers you to import these keys into your preferred wallet, thereby granting comprehensive control over your assets at any given time.

<summary>What security enhancements are on the horizon?</summary>

\-> We're actively planning and developing several security-focused features, including: Automated BSC transfers when your balance exceeds a user-defined threshold.

\-> Capability to whitelist specific addresses for both BSC and token transfers. Implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA) for actions that involve heightened security sensitivity.
